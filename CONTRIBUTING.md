Contributing to MicroLite
=========================

There are a number of ways you can contribute to the MicroLite project:

* Identifying defects - send us a failing unit test
* Fixing defects - send us a fix and supporting unit test(s)
* Implementing features - send us code and unit tests for any enhancement listed in the [issues list](https://github.com/TrevorPilley/MicroLite/issues)

_note: if the defect is one you have identified, please add it as an issue before sending a fix_

In order to contribute any code, you will need to fork the MicroLite repository and then:

* If the change you want to make is to identify a defect, work in develop, add a failing unit test and send a pull request to the develop branch in the main MicroLite repository.
* If the change you want to make is to fix a defect, work in master, add the fix and unit test(s) and send a pull request to both the develop and master branches in the main MicroLite repository.
* If you want to implement a feature, you will either need to work in the development branch or the feature branch if one exists for the specific feature you want to work on and then send a pull request to the corresponding branch in the main MicroLite repository.
