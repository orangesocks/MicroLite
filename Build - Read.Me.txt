The build scripts etc assume that the repository is checked out to C:\Source\GitHub\MicroLite\ - if this is not the case, you may not be able to run the build scripts or open the SandCastle or NDepend projects.

Requirements:

  - Visual Studio 2015 Update 3
  - .NET 4.5.2 and .NET 4.6.2 (http://getdotnet.azurewebsites.net/target-dotnet-platforms.html)
  - StyleCop version 4.7.54 - ensure that MSBuild integration is selected when installed (http://stylecop.codeplex.com/)
  - Git 2.9.3 (http://git-scm.com/download/win)
  - Sandcastle Help File Builder 2016.5.28.0 (https://github.com/EWSoftware/SHFB/releases)

Optional:

  - NDepend 5.0 or later

If running on a 64 bit machine, run the PowerShell (x86) executable otherwise the StyleCop.targets won't be found.

** By default, the build will run in release mode, run all tests and generate the compiled help:

	.\build.ps1

** To also build the NuGet package you must specify the version:

	.\build-nuget.ps1 -version X.X.X

** To also push it to NuGet.org after creating the .nupkg you must supply push true:

	.\build-nuget.ps1 -version X.X.X -push $true
